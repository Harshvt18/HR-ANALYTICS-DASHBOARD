## Problem Statement and Solution

In our organization, we faced several challenges impacting employee satisfaction and operational efficiency:

High Employee Attrition: We identified that a significant number of employees were leaving the company, which was affecting overall team stability and increasing recruitment costs.

Inefficient Hiring Process: Our recruitment process was lengthy and often resulted in suboptimal hires, leading to additional strain on existing teams and prolonged gaps in critical positions.

Subpar Employee Experience: Employees reported dissatisfaction with their work environment and overall job satisfaction, impacting morale and productivity.

Low Workforce Productivity: Despite having a skilled workforce, there were noticeable inefficiencies and lower-than-expected productivity levels.

Lack of Employee Trust: There was a perceived lack of transparency and trust between management and staff, which hindered effective communication and employee engagement.
